Smarties, Skids, Preppies, Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep out of their eyes and head for the main building.',\n 'PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY',\n \" KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, baby blue '75 Dodge Dart. A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack. The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees who his board has hit.\",\n 'RIDER',\n ' Hey -- sorry. Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered belongings.',\n 'KAT',\n ' Leave it He persists.',\n 'KAT (continuing)',\n ' I said, leave it! She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a car, skateboard tip to his throat. He whimpers pitifully and she lets him go.

The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and unaddressed by her side. Bianca smiles proudly, acknowledging her fans.',\n \"GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY\",\n ' CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery guidance counselor.',\n 'MISS PERKY',\n \" I'm sure you won't find Padua any different than your old school. Same little asswipe mother-fuckers everywhere. Her plastic smile never leaves her face. Cameron fidgets in his chair uncomfortably.\",\n 'MISS PERKY',\n '(continuing)',\n ' Any questions?',\n 'CAMERON',\n \" I don't think so, ma'am\",\n 'MISS PERKY',\n \" Then go forth. Scoot I've got deviants to see. Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms Perky's door. His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he is. Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick\",\n 'MISS PERKY',\n '(continuing)',\n \" Patrick Verona. I see we're making our visits a weekly ritual. She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming smile.\",\n 'PATRICK',\n ' I missed you.',\n 'MISS PERKY',\n ' It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.',\n 'PATRICK',\n ' It was a bratwurst.
